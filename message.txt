# Jagi,

Happy valentine's day to the one who managed to turn my ordinary days into delightful ones.

Started from just "add?" in a parkour game and now here I am, learning how to write a romantic letter for you :'D I still can't believe how it went from "EW, I WOULD NEVER" to wherever we are rn XD

You are cute, pretty, kind, fun to be around and very friendly, you really mean a lot to me. I'm grateful for the joy you always bring into my life. I appreciate you more than my coffe, and that's saying something. I find myself smiling whenever I'm talking to you, even whenever my day is going horribly, talking to you would just brighten my day in a second. You always manage to make my world brighter <3 Your presence is like confetti in my life, but better, because it doesn't require vacuuming. Texting you is the highlight of my day, I would never trade the moments I spent with you for anything in the world. (well, maybe for a lifetime supply of chocolate/coffee... oh cheeseburger works too. JOKING JOKING... hmmm am I though?)

You've become an unexpected plot twist in my life story, you're like an amazing, unexpected chapter in my life, and I'm sure I would hold on to that chapter for as long as I can, cause I don't think I'd ever want it to end. 

Today, I just want to say thank you: thank you for being the greatest friend before being a girlfriend to me, thank you for being the unexpected but amazing highlight of my everyday, thank you for always being here for me, thank you for the love, the joy, the memorable moments, and most importantly for tolerating me. I'm forever gonna be sorry for all the times I made you mad or upset.

I love you and I am very lucky to spend this valentines day with you. 

Happy valentine's day, love
